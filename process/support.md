# Support Process

Symbl.ai provides best effort support through the process on this page for Community Projects and Repositories, including all patch releases in the supported minor releases.

## Weekly Rotation

The Symbl.ai maintainers use a weekly rotation to manage community support providing enough maintainers are available. Each week, a different maintainer is the point person for responding to incoming support issues via Slack, GitHub, and the Google group. The point person is *not* expected to be on-call 24x7. Instead, they choose one or more hour(s) per day to be available/responding to incoming issues. They will communicate to the community what that time slot will be each week.

## Start of Week

We will update the public Slack channel's topic to indicate that you are the point person for the week, and what hours you'll be available.

## During the Week

### Where we will monitor

- `#support` in the [Symbl.ai Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/symbldotai/shared_invite/zt-4sic2s11-D3x496pll8UHSJ89cm78CA) channel

### GitHub issue flow

Generally speaking, new GitHub issues will fall into one of several categories. We use the following process for each:

1. **Feature request**
    - Label the issue with `enhancement`
1. **Bug**
    - Label the issue with `bug`
1. **User question/problem** that does not clearly fall into one of the previous categories
    - Label the issue with `question`
    - Add comments as you go, so both the user and future support people have as much context as possible
    - If you resolve the issue with the user, close it out
    - If the issue ends up being a feature request or a bug, update the title and follow the appropriate process for it
    - If the reporter becomes unresponsive after multiple pings, close out the issue due to inactivity and comment that the user can always reach out again as needed

## End of Week

We ensure all GitHub issues worked on during the week and have updated comments so the next person can pick them up.
