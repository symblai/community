## Welcome

This guide will help you understand all aspects of the Symbl.ai Platform and direct
you to the best places to get started contributing. You'll be able to pick up issues,
write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and merged.

This document is the single source of truth for how to contribute to the code
base. Feel free to browse the  [open issues] and file new ones, all feedback
is welcome!

## Contributor Guide

This guide is broken up into the following sections.
It is recommended that you follow these steps in order:

- [Welcome](#welcome) - this page 
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - tasks you need to complete before
  you can start contributing
- [Contributing](./contributor.md) - the main reference guide to contributing

## Prerequisites

Before submitting code, you should first complete the following
prerequisites. Completing these steps will make your first contribution
easier: 

### Create a GitHub account

Before you get started, you will need to [signup](http://github.com/signup) for a GitHub user account. 

### Create a Symbl Platform account

TODO  

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe the [Code of Conduct].

### Setting up your development environment

It is not required to set up a developer environment in order to contribute to
Symbl.ai's community designated projects.

If you plan to contribute code changes, review the [developer resources] page
for how to set up your environment.

## Community

The goal is to create a large, lively, friendly open-source community. As many open
source projects often do, it depends on new people becoming members and regular
code contributors.

## Advanced Topics

This section includes things that need to be documented, but typical contributors
do not need to interact with regularly.
